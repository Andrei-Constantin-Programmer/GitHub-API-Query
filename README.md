# GitHub API Query
This is my first Python project ever!  
It runs some cool scripts on my personal GitHub page and does some computations on my repositories. Feel free to use it on your own repos as well!

## How to Install and Run (using PyCharm)

### Prerequisites
* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

### Install
Either:
1. Clone the repository in PyCharm using this link: https://github.com/Andrei-Constantin-Programmer/GitHub-API-Query.git
2. Download the repository as a zip, extract it and open it as a project using PyCharm

### Setup and Run
1. Create a GitHub token ([Here's how](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))
2. Add the "access_token" environment variable to PyCharm ([Here's a nifty guide on how to do that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42708389/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-pycharm))
3. In the 'setup.py' file, change the user to whatever GitHub profile you want
4. Run the 'main.py' script to run all of the scripts, or run each of them independently
